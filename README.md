# DM_Project
The goal of this project is to conduct a Customer Segmentation for the Marketing Department of an Insurance Company, in order to better understand 
the customerâ€™s different characteristics. We aim to explain and describe the different clustering solutions we obtained and, finally, to approach different 
Marketing techniques for each different group of clients.
